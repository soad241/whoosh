class Facets(object):

    for example::
    
        from whoosh import query
        
        facets = Facets(small=query.Term("size", u"small"),
                        medium=query.Term("size", u"medium"),
                        large=query.Or([query.Term("size", u"large"),
                                        query.Term("size", u"xlarge")]))
    
    ...or you can use the ``add_facet()`` method::
    
        facets = Facets()
        facets.add_facet("small", query.Term("size", u"small"))
    
    Note that the fields used in the queries must of course be indexed. Also
    note that the queries can be complex (for example, you might use range
    queries to create price categories on a numeric field). If you want to show
    multiple facet lists in your results (for exmaple, "price" and "size"),
    you must instantiate multiple Facets objects.
    
    Before you can start categorizing results, you must call the ``study()``
    method with a searcher to can associate the facets with actual documents in
    an index::
    
        searcher = myindex.searcher()
        facets.study(searcher)
    
    (It is not an error if the facets overlap; each document will simply be
    sorted into one category arbitrarily.)
    
    For the common case of using the terms in a certain field as the facets,
    you can create a Facets object and set the facets with the ``from_field``
    method and skip having to call ``study()``::
    
        # Automatically gets the values of the field, sets them up as the
        # facets, and calls study() for you
        facets = Facets().from_field(searcher, "size")
    
    Once you have set up the Facets object, you can use its ``categorize()``
    method to sort search results based on the facets::
    
        # Normally, the searcher uses a bunch of optimizations to avoid working
        # having to look at every search result. However, since we want to know
        # how many documents appeared in each facet, we have to look at every
        # matching document, so use limit=None 
        myresults = searcher.search(myquery, limit=None)
        cats = facets.categorize(myresults)
        
    The ``categorize()`` method returns a dictionary mapping facet names to
    lists of (docnum, score) pairs. The scores are included in case you want
    to, for example, calculate which facet has the highest aggregate score.
    
    For example, if you have a content management system where the documents
    have a "chapter" field, and you want to display results to the user sorted
    by chapter::
    
        searcher = myindex.searcher()
        facets = Facets.from_field(searcher, "chapter")
        
        results = searcher.search(myquery, limit=None)
        print "Query matched %s documents" % len(results)
        
        cats = facets.categorize(results)
        for facetname, facetlist in cats:
            print "%s matching documents in the %s chapter" % (len(facetlist), facetname)
            for docnum, score in facetlist:
                print "-", searcher.stored_fields(docnum).get("title")
            print
